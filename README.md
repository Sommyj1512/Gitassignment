iiiii### Version Control

Version control is a system for tracking changes to project code or files over time, facilitating collaboration and managing different project versions.

### Git and GitHub

- **Git:**
  - A distributed version control system tracking changes locally.
  
- **GitHub:**
  - A web platform hosting Git repositories, enabling collaboration with features like issue tracking and pull requests.

## GitHub Alternatives

1. **GitLab:**
   - Offers a platform similar to GitHub with integrated CI/CD tools.

2. **Bitbucket:**
   - Hosts Git and Mercurial repositories, integrated with other Atlassian tools.

3. **Sourceforge:**
   - A platform for collaborative software development using Git, SVN, or Mercurial.

## Git Commands

- **Get Git:**
  - Checks in changes from an external repository without automatically merging them.

- **Cheer Up:**
  - Checks out changes and merges them into the current branch.

## Git Rebase

Git rebase merges changes from one branch to another by moving or merging multiple commits into a new default commit.
```bash
git rebase
```

## Git Cherry Pick

Git Cherry-Pick applies a specific commit from one branch to another, allowing the selection and application of individual commits.
```bash
cherry picked child
